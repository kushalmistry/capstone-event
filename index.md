### Blockchain

- Blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”)
- When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain
- Types of Blockchain - Public, Private, Consortium
- Benefits of Blockchain:
  a. Greater Transparency
  b. Enchanced Security
  c. Improved Traceability
  d. Increased Efficiency and Speed
  e. Reduced Costs
- Blockchain allows multiple different parties to securely interact with the same universal source of truth
